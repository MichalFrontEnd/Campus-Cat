# Campus-Cat
Online petition with registration, login, canvas signature and editable user profile.

### Description
Student project at Spiced Academy.
In this project I built a petition site that can be found [here](https://campuscat.herokuapp.com).
The cause for this petition is to have cats on campuses, starting with the Spiced Academy campus, for the well-being of the students.

### Technologies
NodeÂ (Express), PostgreSQL, jQuery, Handlebars, Canvas, Adobe Photoshop.
Deployed on Heroku.

### Feautures
* Registration/Login
* Canvas signature
* Editable user profile
* Signers page, can be filtered by city
* Routing middleware that allows only logged-in users to view certain pages, and redirects logged-out users to the registration page.
